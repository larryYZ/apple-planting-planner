The Apple Planting Planner is a full stack development project utilizing React, Express, node.js. It uses the Fruit Tree API as its backend component.

Apple trees usually require two trees to cross-polinate to product fruits. So in most cases more than 2 varieties of apple trees need to be planted within 100ft from each other.

The planner helps gardeners to choose which apple varieties to plant based on two purposes:
1. Achieve cross-polination: Varieties with the same or overlapping blooming time should be planted together
2. Spread out the harvesting season: Varieties with different harvesting time are preferred to avoid an overwhelming large harvest at one time

The website also gives details of different varieties once the user select the variety (data retrived from the Fruit Tree API, which I built). The user can choose to include the variety as one candidate by adding it. And the varity will show up in the tool at the bottom to visualize its blooming period and harvesting period.
